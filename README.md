## Installation üíª

‚ùó To use Steam UI, you must have the [Flutter SDK][flutter_install_link] installed on your machine.

Since this package is not available on pub.dev, you can install it using one of the following methods:

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/solismatias/steam_ui.git
    ```

    Then, add it to your `pubspec.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    dependencies:
      steam_ui:
        path: ../steam_ui
    ```

2. **Use the GitHub repository directly**

    Add this to your `pubspec.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    dependencies:
      steam_ui:
        git:
          url: https://github.com/solismatias/steam_ui.git
    ```
